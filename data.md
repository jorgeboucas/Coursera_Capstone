## Data

The work here presented will be based on the number of inhabitants for each postal code area of the city of Cologne as well as the existing venues information stored by Foursquare.

The number of inhabitants will be acquired from ‘suche-postleitzahl.org’. The names of the neighbourhoods in the respective postal codes is here collected from ‘offenedaten-koeln.de’ and the geometric coordinates of the different neighbourhoods from ‘opendatasoft.com’. Foursquare data will be retrieved through its API.

Foursquare data will be used to understand the already existing consumer trends in the different areas of the city as well as the available and missing services in each respective area.

Ideally, house pricing and socio-economic status associated with the different postal code areas should be included but due to their high costs this data will not be included in this first report. We will instead assume that house pricing and socio-economics correlate with population density i.e. highly dense regions will have higher house pricing due to a high search and demand. Although neighbourhoods with a low population density can also associate with high house costs and incomes per household such neighbourhoods are not attractive for investment in commercial buildings and can therefore be ignored for this analysis.
