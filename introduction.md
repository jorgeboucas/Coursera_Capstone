## Introduction

A large real estate investment company named "REI Commercial" - would like to invest on commercial buildings in Cologne. Cologne is the 4th biggest city in Germany and itâ€™s crossed by the Rhein river.

To maximize their profit, REI Commercial wishes to invest in an upcoming neighbourhood where land and existing buildings are on the raise but not yet reached extremely high prices.

REI Commercial needs to know which kind of building it should invest on i.e. restaurants, supermarkets, shopping centres. The city area to invest on should have already an existing good offer of housing and services as this assures that shops are visited during working hours as well as after working hours raising the profit of the shops and therefore the value of the rents.
